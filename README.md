# D&D Character Generator - Project 2

This application simulates the character generated portions of the Dungeons and Dragons RPG game. Simply view all of your created characters, create a new character, and roll the dice!

<h1>Overview:</h1>
The application has been built with many of the new technologies and languages we've covered in the second half of the UW Bootcamp. Design makeup includes an MVC paradigm and a server side API. The major focus of Project 2 was centered around testing cases, continuous integration, linting, and maximizing code coverage.

<h1>Character Generator Inspiration:</h1>
We derived our application from the D&D Character Generator template. Below is an example:

<h1>Technologies Utilized:</h1>
MySQL, Sequelize, Node, Express, Handlebars, Body Parser, ESLint, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Heroku

<h1>Setup:</h1>
<li>Clone the repository on your local device and open Terminal or Bash
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to download all application dependencies: "npm install"
<li>In Terminal or Bash, the user will run the following command to run the application: "npm run watch"
<li>Once the command is run, a successful message will appear "Server started on port 3000"
<li>In your browser, type "http://localhost:3000/"

<h1>Future Development</h1>
If we were to develop the application further, our efforts would be pushed towards character "battle" functionality. This would simulate a real D&D RPG which enhances the customer experience. Another potential application development would have been on the form itself. Validations for user entry and prompt messages alerting the user to enter correct information are some ideas we could consider.
